LabVIEW is an environment and a language for software creation built by National Instruments. Its main advancement is to use visual diagrams rather than text lines, which makes it more intuitive and outstanding for multiple processors for engineers.

Here's why:

* LabVIEW applications are built out of the building blocks, Virtual Instruments (VIs). These may be part of the library of a toolkit or custom-created by the developers.
* Real-time applications and desktop applications are developed in the same environment.
* Ease of interfacing with instrumentation


### Here're the two main sections of LabVIEW:
1st| The Front Panel:
offers a user interface with controls and indicators for various types of data, such as numbers or text.

2nd| The Block Diagram:
is where the code is written. This involves numerous "nodes" or functions that have inputs and outputs.

## Running some exercises to get familiar with the software:

### Exercise I:
The use of  the Quadrature VI to calculate integrals.

This program is already built on the software to practice or making some modifications ..
Just we need to fill in the upper and lower limit of the integral and change the integrand terms 

As shown in the figure , u should notice that The Block Diagram on the right and The Front Panel on the left as explained above![Picture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67114907/129034568-f7ce9ae6-c3dc-4e1c-9869-498f15a66f13.png)




### Exercise II:

Use a linear, exponential, or power fit function to create a best fit line for generated data.
We need to fill in Number of points, slop, intercept, and noise amplitude then the program will automatically generate a graph to fit the data (it also works for linear, or power fit)
